Problem 1.


There is fox, chicken, grain, and you beside the river with one boat.
When you put only chicken and grain together, chicken eat grain.
Then you put only fox and chicken together, fox eat chicken
And suppose you can put only one things in boat with you.

Our purpose is move all three to the other side of the river.
How? Can we solve this problem by the simulated-anealing technique?


Problem 2.
Make a code that find the answer for n*n magic square.
Magic square is the sum of row, column, diagonal is all same without no multiple usage of integer from [1,n^2].
For exmaple, 3*3 magic square is

492
257
816


Problem 3.

Can we calculate the area of Koch snowflake(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake)?
How? Can we solve this problem by Monte-Carlo simulation?
